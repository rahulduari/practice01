Networking Concept

1.Open Systems Interconnection model,(OSI) MODEL:
 Layers:-
 Application:-this is application layer
 Presentation :-convert to machine understandable language(Encrypted,abstraction,compressed,translation)
 session:-Connections are established and managed.
 transport:-Data is broken into segments for reliable delivery.
 network:-Segments are packaged into packets and routed.
 data link:-Packets are framed and sent to the next device.
 physical:-Frames are converted into bits and transmitted physically
 
 2.Protocols:
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
 3.Domain naming system(DNS):-
 4.Ports:-
 5.Subnetting:-
 6.Routing:-
 7.VPN:-
 8.firewall and security groups
 9.HTTP/HTTPS
 8.Netwoking tools:-
 
 
 
 *IP adress:-
 -> every ipv4/ipv6 address is 4 bytes =8bits each means 8*4=32 bits size
 *Subnets:-a logical subdivision of an IP network, or a network within a network
 *CIDR:-it is basically helps to generate ip adddres's as per our requirement 
 -> if we require 64 ip address then what should be the range   192.168.0.0/26 cal--32-26=6 --2*2*2*2*2*2=64 
 
 *Port:-a virtual or physical connection point that identifies where a network begins and ends
